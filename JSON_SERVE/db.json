During construction, the 18,038 wrought iron elements making up the tower&rsquo;s lattice structure were bolted together at Eiffel&rsquo;s factory on the outskirts of Paris, before being transported to the site, hoisted into place by steam-powered cranes operating from the elevator shafts, and assembled using no less than 2.5 million individual rivets.
